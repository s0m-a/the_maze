THE MAZE GAME

The Maze Game is a first-person 3D maze game reminiscent of classics like Wolfenstein or Doom, focusing on exploration without enemies or weapons, although these features may be incorporated in future updates. Developed using SDL2 and C, it employs raycasting to simulate the illusion of a 3D maze environment. The game is compatible with Mac OS X and Linux/Ubuntu platforms.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Maze Game was crafted in C utilizing the SDL2 library. Development primarily took place on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, using gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4 compiler.

About SDL2 üíª

##Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/s0m-a/the_maze.git

2. Compile the Source Code
" gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic \
    -I/usr/local/include/SDL2 \
    -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
    -lSDL2 -lm \
  ./src/*.c \
   -o maze "

3. Run the Game
./maze maps/map_1

Some basic maps are provided in this repo in the maps/ directory, but you can make your own maps to play as well.
And run it:
  ./maze maps/"name of the map file you created"

##Gameplay Instructions

Navigate through the maze using the arrow keys or ASWE keys. Use left and right arrows (or A and D keys) to rotate the player, and up and down arrows (or W and S keys) to move forward or backward.

By default, the player's starting position and the maze's end goal are determined by the map file. If not specified, the player starts at the top left corner and the goal is located in the last accessible space in the file.

## Map Creation
Refer to the files in the maps/ directory for examples of the maze file format compatible with the game. Different characters represent various elements such as walls, floor, player position, and goal.

Here's a breakdown of the characters' meanings within the game:

**Map File Characters' in Game Meanings**
0: Denotes a floor or walkable space.
1: Represents a red wall.
2: Indicates a green wall.
3: Represents a blue wall.
4: Indicates a yellow wall.
p: Specifies the player's starting position.
